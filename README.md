My first attempt at game programming. This is a simple car game (think Slicks'n'slide) that I hope my son will be able
to play one day (he's crazy about cars).

For now I'm using Angular combined with RxJS and SVG for the visuals. I'll replace some or all of these components in the
future if they seem unfit for the task. Right now it's all about having fun, so I've put all performance issues aside :)

This first version is just to see if I can get all these components to work together. I am planning to come up with
improvements on a semi-regular basis and eventually a proper game.
